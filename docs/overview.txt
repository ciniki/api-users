The users module stores the users which have access to login
to the Ciniki API, or a website which uses the Ciniki API.  
A customer can exists in businesses.business_customers table
and not exist in the users table, which means they are a customer
with no web login.

The user information can be updated by a business if the user 
is not contected with any other businesses via the 
business.business_customers table.  

If a customer is connected
to multiple businesses then the business can issue a forgot password,
or remove them from their business via the customers.customers table.
This will stop the user from being able to login to the business they
were removed from, but still allow them to be login to other businesses.
