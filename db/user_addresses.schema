# Description
# -----------
# The customer_addresses table stores addresses for customers
# for a business.  The customer addresses are stored in two 
# places, the customers module and the users module.  The reason
# for the duplication is to allow business owners to  
# change customer information without affecting other businesses.
# If a customer changes their information, it will get 
# propagated through to this table.  
#
# Fields
# ------
# id:               The id of the address.
#
# user_id: 		    The user the address is attached to. 
#
# flags:            The flags field is a set of bit flags for 
#                   determining how the address should be used.  
#                   One address can be shipping, billing, home and work.
